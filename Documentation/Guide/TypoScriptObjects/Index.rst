==================
TypoScript objects
==================

As we already saw there is quite a variety of TypoScript objects. Each object
has a number of properties. These can be simple data types or functions, which
have their own set of properties. Using properties that don't exist will have

and objects with their properties. This chapter offers a short overview of the
most common objects to give you an idea of what is available.
