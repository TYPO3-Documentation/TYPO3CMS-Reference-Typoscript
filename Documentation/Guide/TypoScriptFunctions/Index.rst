TypoScript functions
====================

TypoScript functions can be considered as a set of common properties. Whenever
an object has a property corresponding to a given function, you are assured to
have that set of properties available.

This chapter gives you a brief overview of the most common functions available
in TypoScript. As always the :doc:`TypoScript Reference <Index>` is the
ultimate source of knowledge on the matter. For each object property, it
indicates whether it is a simple data type or a function.

The most used function is the "standard wrap", usually known as "stdWrap". Due
to its importance, it is entitled to
:ref:`its very own chapter <guide-using-stdwrap>`.

**The functions:**
