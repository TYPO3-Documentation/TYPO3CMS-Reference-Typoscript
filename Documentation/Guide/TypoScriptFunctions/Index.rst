TypoScript functions
====================

TypoScript functions can be considered as a set of common properties. Whenever
an object has a property corresponding to a given function, you are assured to
have that set of properties available.

This chapter gives you a brief overview of the most common functions available
in TypoScript. See chapter :ref:`Functions <functions>` for a complete list.

The most used function is the "standard wrap", usually known as "stdWrap".
