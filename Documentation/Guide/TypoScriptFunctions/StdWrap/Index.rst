=======================
Using stdWrap correctly
=======================

The :ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>` function is one of the most powerful and
most widely used of all TypoScript. Most properties actually support `stdWrap`
turning each of them into some kind of Swiss army knife.

`stdWrap` is very rich, having itself a large number of properties. This
chapter is intended to give you a feel for `stdWrap` so that you may get
familiar with it and be ready to explore it in greater depth using the
:ref:`TypoScript Reference <stdwrap>`.
