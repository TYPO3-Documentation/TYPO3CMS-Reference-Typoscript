Heed the order
==============

The single most important thing to know about `stdWrap` is that all
properties are parsed/executed exactly in the order in which they appear in the
:ref:`TypoScript Reference <stdwrap>`, no matter in which order you
have set them in your TypoScript record.

Let's consider this example:

..  literalinclude:: /Guide/TypoScriptFunctions/StdWrap/_snippets/_order.typoscript

It results in the following:

..  code-block:: html

    <strong>Tool: TYPO3</strong>

The `case` property is executed before the `noTrimWrap` property.
Hence only "typo3" was changed to uppercase and not the "Tool:" with which it
is wrapped.
