================
Modify the order

There is a way around this ordering restriction. `stdWrap` has a property
called `orderedStdWrap` in which several `stdWrap` properties can
be called in numerical order. Thus:

..  literalinclude:: /Guide/TypoScriptFunctions/StdWrap/_snippets/_orderedStdWrap.typoscript

results in:

..  code-block:: html

    <strong>TOOL: TYPO3</strong>

because we explicitly specified that `noTrimWrap` should happen before
`case`.

It should be noted that `stdWrap` itself has a `stdWrap` property,
meaning that it can be called recursively. In most case `orderedStdWrap`
will do the job and is much easier to understand making code easier to
maintain.
