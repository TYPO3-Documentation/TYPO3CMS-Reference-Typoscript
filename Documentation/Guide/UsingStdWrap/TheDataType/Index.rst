=============
The data type
=============

While writing TypoScript, it is crucial to know what kind of data type
you are handling. It is common to see beginners try to combine functions
arbitrarily, until the anticipated result is finally achieved by accident.

The :ref:`TypoScript reference <stdWrap>` is very clear about
which properties exist and what their data type is, so please refer
to that essential resource while writing your TypoScript configuration.
