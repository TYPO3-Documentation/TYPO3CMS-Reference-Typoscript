=================================
Insert content in a HTML template
=================================

Although we now know how to render content, we do not
have a real website yet.

Again everything could be done using TypoScript. That would be pretty complex
and error prone. Furthermore if a HTML template file is prepared by a designer
for the website, it would be a shame not to reuse it as is as much as
possible. It would also make further corrections to the HTML template much
harder to apply.

TYPO3 CMS provides the :ref:`FLUIDTEMPLATE <cobj-fluidtemplate>`
object, with which we can use Fluid template and render our website with it:

..  literalinclude:: /Guide/Content/_snippets/_FLUIDTEMPLATE.typoscript

In your template file you can now replace the parts that should be filled by
TYPO3 with references to the TypoScript configuration objects you defined
earlier.

For example to render a template with the menu we defined add:

..  literalinclude:: /Guide/Content/_snippets/_Fluid.html
