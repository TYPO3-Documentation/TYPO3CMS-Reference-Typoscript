Armed with this basic knowledge of TypoScript, you may want
to continue your exploration of TYPO3 CMS by following the
:doc:`Sitepackage Tutorial <t3sitepackage:Index>`, which will
guide you through the creation of a whole website template
using TypoScript.

To learn more about the structure and syntax of TypoScript,
you can refer to the :ref:`TypoScript Syntax and In-depth Study<t3coreapi:typoscript-syntax-start>`
reference.

Finally - as was mentioned again and again throughout this tutorial -
the ultimate resource about TypoScript objects, functions and
data types is the :doc:`TypoScript Reference <Index>`.
