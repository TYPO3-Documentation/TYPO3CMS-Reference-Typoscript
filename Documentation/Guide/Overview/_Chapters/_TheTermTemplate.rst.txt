===================
The term "template"
===================

Sometimes the term "template" is used as a synonym for the TypoScript record
or the combined TypoScript configuration from all sources. This has historic
reasons. Until TYPO3 v11 TypoScript could be edited in a backend module
called "Template". In the beginning of TYPO3 sites were build almost
exclusively with TypoScript while it slowly evolved to be mainly a configuration
language.

As a Fluid template is also called "template" the terms took on a double meaning
in TYPO3. With TYPO3 v12 we speak about TypoScript records, TypoScript files
and the complete TypoScript configuration. However you will still find the
outdated term "TypoScript template" or just "template" in places.

Troubleshooting
===============

Common mistakes made in the TypoScript configuration can cause a message like this:

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/NoTypoScriptTemplateFoundDebuggingOff.png
    :alt: Error message "No TypoScript record found!"

If you turn on the :ref:`debug mode <t3coreapi:troubleshooting-debug-mode>`
you will get more detailed information:

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/NoTypoScriptTemplateFound.png
   :alt: Error message "No TypoScript record found!"

`No TypoScript record found!`: This warning appears if no TypoScript record,
with the `root level` flag enabled, is found in the page tree.

..  figure:: /Images/ManualScreenshots/ThePageIsNotConfigured.png
   :alt: Error message "The page is not configured!"

`The page is not configured! [type=0][]`. This means that there is no TypoScript
object of type PAGE with typeNum=0 configured.`: This warning appears if the
TypoScript Configuration of the current page contains no :ref:`PAGE <guide-page>`
definition.

The following TypoScript setup code is enough to remove this warning:

..  literalinclude:: /Guide/Overview/_snippets/_page1.typoscript

Do not worry about this code for now, it will be explained later.
