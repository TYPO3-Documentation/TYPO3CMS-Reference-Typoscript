TypoScript - A quick overview
=============================

This introduction is designed to give you a
comprehensive understanding of how TypoScript works.
In other words the goal is not to just help you make it work,
but to make sure that you end up knowing why and how
it works.

At the end of this tutorial, you will not have a complete
TYPO3 CMS-powered website, but you should feel confident about
how to get there.

A common workflow used by beginners is to try arbitrary
properties on objects until things somehow begin to work.
However understanding how TypoScript really works
allows you to proceed more efficiently and waste less time
in painful trial and error.

Going through this tutorial is helpful for understanding
other tutorials, like the :ref:`Site package tutorial <t3sitepackage:start>`.
