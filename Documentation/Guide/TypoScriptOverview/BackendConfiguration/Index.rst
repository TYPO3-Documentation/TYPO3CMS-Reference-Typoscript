=====================
Backend configuration
=====================

TypoScript influences many aspects of a TYPO3 site:

TypoScript can be used in the TSconfig field of a backend user or a
backend user group or in the TSconfig field of a page. It will then
change the look and behavior of forms in the *backend*.

The *frontend* rendering in contrast is defined by the TypoScript
used in TypoScript templates. This document covers only frontend
rendering.
