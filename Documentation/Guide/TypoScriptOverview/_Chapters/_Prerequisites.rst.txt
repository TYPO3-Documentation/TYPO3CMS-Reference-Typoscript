Prerequisites
=============

It is assumed that you have a running TYPO3 installation.
See :ref:`TYPO3 Getting Started Tutorial, installing TYPO3 with DDEV <t3start:installation-ddev-tutorial>`.

and that you have been through the
:ref:`TYPO3 - Getting Started Tutorial <t3start:start>` in order
to have a general idea of how the TYPO3 CMS backend operates.

A few more elements that you need to know before starting:

*   all content elements are stored in a database table called `tt_content`

*   each content element has a database field called `CType` in which
    the type of the content element is stored

*   the `tt_content` table also has a field called `pid` which refers
    to the page the content element is on

*   in general, each TYPO3 CMS table has a field called `uid` which
    contains the primary key (unique id for each record)

*   you will probably find useful to have a database access to check
    how information is stored as we proceed along this tutorial
