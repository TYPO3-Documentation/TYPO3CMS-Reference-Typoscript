Top-level objects
=================

As described in the :ref:`TypoScript syntax introduction <t3coreapi:typoscript-syntax-introduction>`
TypoScript templates are converted into a multidimensional PHP array.
You can view this in the TypoScript object browser. Top level
objects are located on the top level. Top level objects are for
example `config` or `plugin`.

* Some have an **explicit object type**, such as `PAGE` for `page`
  or `CONFIG` for `config`,
  some may be filled arbitrarily by extensions.
* Some of these are already **initialized** by TYPO3, such as `config`
  or `plugin`, some must be initialized explicitly, such as `page`.
