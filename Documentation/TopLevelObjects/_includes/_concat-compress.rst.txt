..  hint::

    Enabling concatenation and/or compression requires several filesystem operations
    and can considerably impact frontend request time performance, especially for
    uncached pages. For optimal performance, you should prefer
    to pre-bundle as many CSS/JS assets as possible via a frontend
    buildchain. Also, you can try to utilize HTTP/2 multiplexing on your
    webserver, which performs much better than HTTP/1 for requesting multiple 
    small files. It also leverages distinct cacheability of these CSS/JS assets.

    Most servers can be configured to dynamically compress specific
    file types on-the-fly, which is preferable to using application-level
    compression.
