======
select
======

This object generates an SQL-select statement to select records
from the database.

Some records are hidden or timed by start- and end-times. This is
automatically added to the SQL-select by looking for "enablefields"
in the :php:`$GLOBALS['TCA']`.

.. warning::

   Do not use GET or POST data like GPvar directly with this object!
   Avoid SQL injections! Don't trust any external data! Secure
   any unknown data, for example with :ref:`intval <stdwrap-intval>`.

.. _selectQuotingOfFields:

Quoting of fields
=================

.. versionadded:: 8.7

   It is possible to use `{#fieldname}` to make the database
   framework quote these fields (see :doc:`ext_core:Changelog/8.7/Important-80506-DbalCompatibleFieldQuotingInTypoScript`)::

      select.where = ({#title} LIKE {#%SOMETHING%} AND NOT {#doktype})

This applies to:

* :typoscript:`select.where`

but not to:

* :typoscript:`select.groupBy`
* :typoscript:`select.orderBy`

as these parameters already follow a stricter syntax that allow automatic parsing and
quoting.

Comprehensive example
=====================

See PHP source code for
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Frontend\ContentObject\ContentObjectRenderer`,
:php:`ContentObjectRenderer::getQuery()`,
:php:`ContentObjectRenderer::getWhere()`.


.. Preamble: :
   # Note: TypoScript (TS) is just another way to define an array of settings which
   #       is later on INTERPRETED by TYPO3. TypoScript can be written in ANY order
   #       as long as it leads to the same array. Actual execution order is TOTALLY
   #       INDEPENDENT of TypoScript code order.
   #
   #       The order of TS in this example however tries to reflect execution order.
   #       The denoted steps are taking place in that order at execution time.

.. _select-uidInList:

uidInList
=========

:aspect:`Property`
   uidInList

:aspect:`Data type`
   *list of record\_ids* / :ref:`stdWrap`

:aspect:`Description`
   Comma-separated list of record uids from the according database table.
   For example when the select function works on the table `tt_content`, then
   this will be uids of `tt_content` records.

   **Note:** :typoscript:`this` is a *special keyword* and replaced with the id of the
   *current record*.

:aspect:`Example`
   ::

      select.uidInList = 1,2,3
      select.uidInList = this


.. _select-pidInList:

pidInList
=========

:aspect:`Property`
   pidInList

:aspect:`Data type`
   *list of page\_ids* / :ref:`stdWrap`

:aspect:`Description`
   Comma-separated list of pids of the record. This will be page uids (pids). For
   example when the select function works on the table tt_content, then this
   will be pids of tt_content records, the parent pages of these records.

   Pages in the list, which are not visible for the website user, *are
   automatically removed* from the list. Thereby no records from hidden,
   timed or access-protected pages will be selected! Nor will be records
   from recyclers. Exception: The hidden pages will be listed in *preview mode*.

   **Special keyword:** :typoscript:`this`
      Is replaced with the id of the current page.

   **Special keyword:** :typoscript:`root`
      Allows to select records from the root-page level (records with pid=0,
      e.g. useful for the table "sys_category" and others).

   **Special value:** :typoscript:`-1`
      Allows to select versioned records in workspaces directly.

   **Special value:** :typoscript:`0`
      Allows to disable the :sql:`pid` constraint completely. Requirements:
      :typoscript:`uidInList` *must* be set or the table *must* have the prefix
      "static\_\*".

   .. note::
      Check the doktype of your backend page. If you are trying to fetch records from
      a sys_folder for example, the :php:`$cObj->checkPid_badDoktypeList` method will insert the
      following SQL into your query:

      .. code-block:: sql

         [...]WHERE (`your_requested_table_name`.`uid` = 0) AND [...]

      Which might result in an empty query result, depending on your records.

:aspect:`Default`
   :typoscript:`this`

:aspect:`Example`
   Fetch related `sys_category` records stored in the MM intermediate table::

      10 = CONTENT
      10 {
         table = sys_category
         select {
            pidInList = root,-1
            selectFields = sys_category.*
            join = sys_category_record_mm ON sys_category_record_mm.uid_local = sys_category.uid
            where.data = field:_ORIG_uid // field:uid
            where.intval = 1
            where.wrap = sys_category_record_mm.uid_foreign=|
            orderBy = sys_category_record_mm.sorting_foreign
            languageField = 0 # disable translation handling of sys_category
         }
      }

orderBy
=======

:aspect:`Property`
   orderBy

:aspect:`Data type`
   *SQL-orderBy* / :ref:`stdWrap`

===

:aspect:`Property`
   max

:aspect:`Data type`
   :ref:`data-type-integer` + :ref:`objects-calc` +"total" / :ref:`stdWrap`

:aspect:`Description`
   Max records

   **Special keyword:** "total" is substituted with :php:`count(*)`.


.. _select-begin:

begin
=====

:aspect:`Property`
      begin

:aspect:`Data type`
      :ref:`data-type-integer` + :ref:`objects-calc` +"total" / :ref:`stdWrap`

:aspect:`Description`
      Begin with record number *value*.

      **Special keyword:** :typoscript:`total`
         Is substituted with :php:`count(*)`.


.. _select-where:

where
=====

:aspect:`Property`
      where

:aspect:`Data type`
      *SQL-where* / :ref:`stdWrap`

:aspect:`Description`
      WHERE clause without the word "WHERE".

:aspect:`Example`
      ::

         where = (title LIKE '%SOMETHING%' AND NOT doktype)

      Use `{#fieldname}` to make the database
      framework quote these fields::

         where = ({#title} LIKE {#%SOMETHING%} AND NOT {#doktype})


.. _select-languageField:

languageField
=============

:aspect:`Property`
   languageField

:aspect:`Data type`
   :ref:`data-type-string` / :ref:`stdWrap`

:aspect:`Description`
   This defaults to whatever is defined in TCA "ctrl"-section in the
   "languageField". Change it to overwrite the behaviour in your query.

   By default all records that have language-relevant information in the
   TCA "ctrl"-section are translated on translated pages.

   This behaviour can be disabled by setting :typoscript:`languageField = 0`.


.. _select-includeRecordsWithoutDefaultTranslation:

includeRecordsWithoutDefaultTranslation
=======================================

:aspect:`Property`
   includeRecordsWithoutDefaultTranslation

:aspect:`Data type`
   :ref:`data-type-bool` / :ref:`stdWrap`

:aspect:`Description`
   If content language overlay is activated and the option :typoscript:`languageField` is not disabled,
   :typoscript:`includeRecordsWithoutDefaultTranslation` allows to additionally fetch records,
   which do **not** have a parent in the default language.

:aspect:`Default`
   0

:aspect:`Description`
   List of fields to select, or :php:`count(*)`.

   If the records need to be localized, please include the
   relevant localization-fields (uid, pid, languageField and
   transOrigPointerField). Otherwise the TYPO3 internal localization
   will not succeed.

:aspect:`Default`
   \*


.. _select-join:
.. _select-leftjoin:
.. _select-rightjoin:

join, leftjoin, rightjoin
=========================

:aspect:`Property`
   join, leftjoin, rightjoin

:aspect:`Data type`
   :ref:`data-type-string` / :ref:`stdWrap`

:aspect:`Description`
   Enter the table name for JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN and RIGHT OUTER JOIN
   respectively.


.. _select-markers:

markers
=======

:aspect:`Property`
   markers

:aspect:`Data type`
   *(array of markers)*

:aspect:`Description`
   The markers defined in this section can be used, wrapped in the usual
   ###markername### way, in any other property of select. Each value is
   properly escaped and quoted to prevent SQL injection problems. This
   provides a way to safely use external data (e.g. database fields,
   GET/POST parameters) in a query.

   Available sub-properties:

   <markername>.value (value)
      Sets the value directly.

   <markername>.commaSeparatedList (:ref:`data-type-boolean`)
      If set, the value is interpreted as a comma-separated list of values.
      Each value in the list is individually escaped and quoted.

   (stdWrap properties ...)
      All stdWrap properties can be used for each markername.


   .. warning::

      Since TYPO3 8 there is a problem combining orderBy with markers caused
      by the quoting of the fields, see :issue:`87799`.

:aspect:`Example`
   ::

      page.60 = CONTENT
      page.60 {
            table = tt_content
            select {
               pidInList = 73
               where = header != ###whatever###
               markers {
                  whatever.data = GP:first
               }
            }
      }

   This example selects all records from table tt_content, which are on page 73 and
   which don't have the header set to the value provided by the Get/Post variable
   "first".

   ::

      page.60 = CONTENT
      page.60 {
            table = tt_content
            select {
               pidInList = 73
               where = header != ###whatever###
               markers {
                  whatever.value = some
                  whatever.wrap = |thing
               }
            }
      }


   This examples selects all records from the table tt_content which are on page 73
   and which don't have a header set to a value constructed by whatever.value and
   whatever.wrap ('something').
