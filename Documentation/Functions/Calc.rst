Calc
====

Sometimes a data type is set to "something +calc". "+calc" indicates
that the value is calculated with "+-/\*". *Be aware that the
operators have no "weight".* The calculation is just done from left to
right.


Example
=======

::

   45 + 34 * 2 = 158
   (which is the same as this in ordinary arithmetic: (45+34)*2=158)
