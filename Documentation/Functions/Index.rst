The complex data type :ref:`TEXT <cobj-text>` has a property "value"
which is defined as having a simple data type "string" with the optional
type modifier "stdWrap".

The data type would then be written as
":ref:`data-type-string` /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`".

The following functions are defined in TypoScript:
