Sometimes a data type is defined as having a modifier. This is typically a function
that can be used additionally.

Example:
   The complex data type :ref:`TEXT <cobj-text>` has a property "value" which is defined as having a simple
   data type "string" with the optional type modifier "stdWrap":

   .. ### BEGIN~OF~TABLE ###

   .. container:: table-row

      Property
            value

      Data type
            :t3-data-type:`string` /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`
