===========
optionSplit
===========

optionSplit is a very tricky function. It's primarily used in the
menu objects where you define properties of a whole bunch of items at
once. Here the value of properties would be parsed through this
function and depending on your setup you could e.g. let the last menu-
item appear with another color than the others.


.. _objects-optionsplit-syntax:

Syntax
~~~~~~

The syntax is like this:

\|\*\| splits the value in parts *first, middle* and *last*.

\|\| splits each of the parts *first, middle* and *last* in subparts.


.. _objects-optionsplit-rules:

The four rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following four rules are used by optionSplit:

#. The priority is *last, first, middle*.

#. If the *middle*-value is empty (""), the last part of the first-
   value is repeated.

#. If the *first* - and *middle* value are empty, the first part of the
   last-value is repeated before the last value.

#. The *middle* value is repeated.

Example::

   first1 || first2 |*| middle1 || middle2 || middle3 |*| last1 || last2


Examples:
~~~~~~~~~

This is very complex and you might think that this has gone too far.
But it's actually useful.

Now consider a menu with five items:

   Introduction

   Who are we?

   Business

   Contact

   Links

... and a configuration like this::

   temp.topmenu.1.NO {
     backColor = red
     ....
   }

If you look in this reference (see later) at the linkWrap property of
the GMENU object, you'll discover that all properties of *.NO* are
parsed through *optionSplit*. This means that before the individual
menu items are generated, the properties are split by this function.
Now lets look at some examples:


Subparts \|\|
'''''''''''''


Example:
~~~~~~~~

All items take on the same value. Only the *first* -part is defined
and thus it's repeated to all elements ::

   TS:        backColor = red

..

   Introduction (red)

   Who are we? (red)

   Business (red)

   Contact (red)

   Links (red)


Example:
~~~~~~~~

Here the *first-* part is split into subparts. The third subpart is
repeated because the menu has five items. ::

   TS:        backColor = red || yellow || green

..

   **Introduction** (red)first, subpart 1

   Who are we? (yellow) first, subpart 2

   Business (green) first, subpart 3

   Contact (green) first, subpart 3 (repeated)

   Links (green) first, subpart 3 (repeated)


Parts \|\*\|
''''''''''''


Example:
~~~~~~~~

Now a *middle*-value is also defined ("*white*"). This means that
after the first two menu-items the *middle*-value is used. ::

   TS:        backColor = red || yellow |*| white

..

   Introduction (red) first, subpart 1

   Who are we? (yellow) first, subpart 2

   **Business** (white) middle

   Contact (white) middle

   Links (white) middle


Example:
~~~~~~~~

Now a *last*-value is also defined ("*blue \|\| olive"*). This
means that after the first two menu-items the *middle*-value is used. ::

   TS:        backColor = red || yellow |*| white |*| blue || olive

..

   Introduction (red) first, subpart 1

   Who are we? (yellow) first, subpart 2

   **Business** (white) middle

   Contact (blue) last, subpart 1

   Links (olive) last, subpart 2

... and if we expand the menu a bit (*middle*-value is repeated!)

   Introduction (red) first, subpart 1

   Who are we? (yellow) first, subpart 2

   **Business** (white) middle

   .... (white) middle

   .... (white) middle

   .... (white) middle

   .... (white) middle

   Contact (blue) last, subpart 1

   Links (olive) last, subpart 2

... and if we contract the menu to only four items (the *middle*
-value is discarded as it's priority is the least)

   Introduction (red) first, subpart 1

   Who are we? (yellow) first, subpart 2

   Contact (blue) last, subpart 1

   Links (olive) last, subpart 2

... and if we contract the menu to only 3 items (the last subpart of
the *first*-value is discarded as it's priority is less than the
*last*-value)

   Introduction (red) first, subpart 1

   Contact (blue) last, subpart 1

   Links (olive) last, subpart 2


"1: The priority is *last, first, middle*"
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Now the last two examples showed that the *last*-value has the
highest priority, then the *first*-value and then the *middle*
-value.


"2: If the *middle*-value is empty, the last part of the first-value is repeated"
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


Example:
~~~~~~~~

The *middle*-value is left out now. Then subpart 2 of the first
value is repeated. *Please observe that no space must exist between
the two \|\*\|\|\*\|!* ::

   TS:        backColor = red || yellow |*||*| blue || olive

..

   Introduction (red) first, subpart 1

   Who are we? (yellow) first, subpart 2

   **Business** (yellow) first, subpart 2 (repeated)

   Contact (blue) last, subpart 1

   Links (olive) last, subpart 2


"3: If the *first* - and *middle* value are empty, the first part of the last-value is repeated before the last value"
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


Example:
~~~~~~~~

The *middle*-value and *first*-value are left out now. Then the
subpart 1 of the last value is repeated. *Please observe that no
space must exist between the two \|\*\|\|\*\|!* ::

   TS:        backColor = |*||*| blue || olive

..

   Introduction (blue) last, subpart 1 (repeated)

   Who are we? (blue) last, subpart 1 (repeated)

   **Business** (blue) last, subpart 1 (repeated)

   Contact (blue) last, subpart 1

   Links (olive) last, subpart 2


"4: The *middle* value is repeated"
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''


Example:
~~~~~~~~

::

   TS:        backColor = red |*| yellow || green |*|

..

   **Introduction** (red) first

   Who are we? (yellow) middle, subpart 1

   **Business** (green) middle, subpart 2

   .... (yellow) middle, subpart 1

   .... (green) middle, subpart 2

   .... (yellow) middle, subpart 1

   .... (green) middle, subpart 2

   **Contact** (yellow) middle, subpart 1

   **Links** (green) middle, subpart 2
