typolink
========

Wraps the incoming value with a link.

*Attention:*
If this is used from :typoscript:`parseFunc` the :php:`$cObj->parameters` array is
loaded with the lowercased link-parameters!

Wraps the incoming value in a link with an HTML 'a' tag.

If you do not want to have the HTML 'a' tag around the link, then you
must set the property by :typoscript:`returnLast = url` or
:php:`$lconf['returnLast'] = 'url'`.

*Attention:*
If this is used from :typoscript:`parseFunc` the :php:`$cObj->parameters` array is
loaded with the lowercased link-parameters!

Examples
========

Create a link to page with uid 2::

   page.20 = TEXT
   page.20.value = anchor text
   page.20.typolink.parameter = 2

Output:

.. code-block:: html

   <a href="/somepage">anchor text</a>

Just display the URL::

   page.30 = TEXT
   page.30.typolink.parameter = 2
   page.30.typolink.returnLast = url

Output:

.. code-block:: html

   /somepage


.. ### BEGIN~OF~TABLE ###

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         extTarget

   Data type
         target /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Target used for external links

   Default
         \_top


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         fileTarget

   Data type
         target /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Target used for file links


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         target

   Data type
         target /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Target used for internal links


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         no\_cache

   Data type
         boolean /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Adds "&no\_cache=1" to the link


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         useCacheHash

   Data type
         boolean

   Description
         If set, the additionalParams list is exploded and calculated into a
         hash string appended to the URL, like "&cHash=ae83fd7s87". When the
         caching mechanism sees this value, it calculates the same value on the
         server based on incoming values in HTTP\_GET\_VARS, excluding
         id, type, no\_cache, ftu, cHash, MP values. If the incoming cHash value
         matches the calculated value, the page may be cached based on this.

         The $TYPO3\_CONF\_VARS['SYS']['encryptionKey'] is included in the hash
         in order to make it unique for the server and non-predictable.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         additionalParams

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         This is parameters that are added to the end of the URL. This must be
         code ready to insert after the last parameter.

         Example
            ::

               '&print=1'
               '&sword\_list[]=word1&sword\_list[]=word2'

         Applications
            This is very useful – for example – when linking to pages from a
            search result. The search words are stored in the register-key
            SWORD\_PARAMS and can be insert directly like this::

               .additionalParams.data = register:SWORD_PARAMS

            *Note:* This is only active for internal links.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         addQueryString

   Data type
         boolean

   Description
         Add the QUERY\_STRING to the start of the link. Notice that this does
         not check for any duplicate parameters! This is not a problem: Only
         the last parameter of the same name will be applied.

         .method
            If set to GET or POST, then the parsed query arguments
            (GET or POST data) will be used. This setting is useful, if you use
            URL processing extensions like Real URL, which translate part of the
            path into query arguments.

            It's also possible to get both, POST and GET data, on setting this to

            "POST,GET" or "GET,POST". The last method in this sequence takes
            precedence and overwrites the parts that are also present for the
            first method.

         .exclude
            List of query arguments to exclude from the link. Typical examples
            are 'L' or 'cHash'.

         .. attention::

            This property should not be used for cached contents without a valid
            cHash. Otherwise the page is cached for the first set of parameters
            and subsubsequently taken from the cache no matter what parameters
            are given. Additionally the security risk of cache poisoning has to
            be considered.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         wrap

   Data type
         wrap /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Wraps the links.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         ATagBeforeWrap

   Data type
         boolean

   Description
         If set, the link is first wrapped with :typoscript:`.wrap` and then the
         <A>-tag.

   Default
         0

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         parameter

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         This is the main data that is used for creating the link. It can be
         the id of a page, the URL of some external page, an email address or
         a reference to a file on the server. On top of this there can be
         additional information for specifying a target, a class and a title.
         Below are a few examples followed by full explanations.

   Examples
         1. Most simple. Will create a link to page 51::

               parameter = t3://page?uid=51

         2. A full example. A link to page 51 that will open in a new window.
            The link will have a class attribute with value "specialLink" and a
            title attribute reading "Very important information"::

               parameter = t3://page?uid=51 _blank specialLink "Very important information"

         3. which is converted to a link like this::

               <a href="?id=51" target="_blank" class="specialLink" title="Very important information">

         4. An external link with a class attribute. Note the dash (-) that
            replaces the second value (the target). This makes it possible to
            define a class (third value) without having to define a target::

               parameter = https://example.org/ - specialLink

         5. A mailto link with a title attribute (but no target and no class)::

               parameter = mailto:info@example.org - - "Send a mail to main TYPO3 contact"

         As you can see from the examples, each significant part of the
         parameter string is separated by a space. Values that can themselves
         contain spaces must be enclosed in double quotes. Each of these values
         are described in more detail below.

   Resource reference
         1. The link

            The first value is the destination of the link. It may start with:

            -  `t3://`: internal TYPO3 resource references.
               See `Resource references`_ for an in depth explanation on the
               syntax of these references.

            -  `http(s)://`: regular external links

            -  `mailto:info@example.org`: regular mailto links

            It's also possible to direct the typolink to use a custom function (a
            "link handler") to build the link. This is described in more detail
            below.

         2. Target or popup settings

            Targets are normally as described above (extTarget, fileTarget,
            target). But it is possible to override them by explicitly defining
            a target in the parameter property. It's possible to use a dash (-)
            to skip this value when one wants to define a third or fourth
            value, but no target.

            Instead of a target, this second value can be used to define the
            parameters of a JavaScript popup window into which the link will be
            opened (using window.open). The height and width of the window can be
            defined, as well as additional parameters to be passed to the
            JavaScript function. Also see property "Jswindow".

            Examples
               Open page 51 in a popup window measuring 400 by 300 pixels::

                  typolink.parameter = 51 400x300

               Open page 51 in a popup window measuring 400 by 300 pixels. Do
               not make the window resizable and show the location bar::

                  typolink.parameter = 51 400x300:resizable=0,location=1

         3. Class

            The third value can be used to define a class name for the link tag.
            This class is inserted in the tag before any other value from the
            "ATagParams" property. Beware of conflicting class attributes. It's
            possible to use a dash (-) to skip this value when one wants to define
            a fourth value, but no class (see examples above).

         4. Title

            The standard way of defining the title attribute of the link would
            be to use the :typoscript:`title` property or even the :typoscript:`ATagParams`
            property. However it can also be set in this fourth value, in which
            case it will override the other settings. Note that the title
            should be wrapped in double quotes (") if it contains blanks.

            *Attention:* When used from :typoscript:`parseFunc`, the value should not
            be defined explicitly, but imported like this::

               typolink.parameter.data = parameters : allParams


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         forceAbsoluteUrl

   Data type
         boolean

   Description
         Forces links to internal pages to be absolute, thus having a proper
         URL scheme and domain prepended.

         Additional sub-property:

         .scheme
            Defines the URL scheme to be used (https or http). http is the
            default value. Example::

               typolink {
                  parameter = 13
                  forceAbsoluteUrl = 1
                  forceAbsoluteUrl.scheme = https
               }

   Default
         0


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         title

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Sets the title parameter of the A-tag.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         JSwindow\_params

   Data type
         string

   Description
         Preset values for opening the window. This example lists almost all
         possible attributes::

            status=1,menubar=1,scrollbars=1,resizable=1,location=1,directories=1,toolbar=1


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         returnLast

   Data type
         string

   Description
         If set to "url", then it will return the URL of the link
         ($this->lastTypoLinkUrl).

         If set to "target", it will return the target of the link.

         So, in these two cases you will not get the value wrapped but the URL
         or target value returned!


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         section

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         If this value is present, it's prepended with a "#" and placed after
         any internal URL to another page in TYPO3.

         This is used create a link, which jumps from one page directly the
         section on another page.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         ATagParams

   Data type
         <A>-params /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Additional parameters

         Example::

            class="board"


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         linkAccessRestrictedPages

   Data type
         boolean

   Description
         If set, typolinks pointing to access restricted pages will still link
         to the page even though the page cannot be accessed.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         userFunc

   Data type
         function name

   Description
         This passes the link-data compiled by the typolink function to a user-
         defined function for final manipulation.

         The :php:`$content` variable passed to the user-function (first parameter) is
         an array with the keys "TYPE", "TAG", "url", "targetParams" and
         "aTagParams".

         TYPE is an indication of link-kind: mailto, url, file, page

         TAG is the full <A>-tag as generated and ready from the typolink
         function.

         The actual tag value is constructed like this:

         .. code-block:: php

            $contents = '<a href="' . $finalTagParts['url'] . '"'
                        . $finalTagParts['targetParams']
                        . $finalTagParts['aTagParams'] . '>';

         The userfunction must return an <A>-tag.

.. _typolink-resource_references: `Resource references`

Resource references
===================

TYPO3 supports a modern and future-proof way of referencing resources using an
extensible and expressive syntax which is easy to understand.

In order to understand the syntax, we will guide you through using a simple
page link.

`t3://page?uid=13&campaignCode=ABC123`

The syntax consists of three main parts, much like parts on an URL:

Syntax Namespace (`t3://`)
   The namespace is set to `t3://` to ensure the `LinkService` should be called
   to parse the URL. This value is fixed and mandatory.

Resource handler key (`page`)
   The resource handler key is a list of available handlers that TYPO3 can work
   with. At the time of writing these handlers are:

   - page
   - file
   - folder

   More keys can be added via :php:`$TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SYS']['linkHandler']` in
   an associative array where the key is the handler key and the value is a
   class implementing the LinkHandlerInterface.

Resource parameters (`?uid=13&campaignCode=ABC123`)
   These are the specific identification parameters that are used by any
   handler. Note that these may carry additional parameters in order to
   configure the behavior of any handler.

Handler syntax
==============

page
----

The page identifier is a compound string based on several optional settings.

:aspect:`uid` (int):

   The **uid** of a page record.

   `t3://page?uid=13`

:aspect:`alias` (string):

   The **alias** of a page record (as an alternative to the UID).

   `t3://page?alias=myfunkyalias`

:aspect:`type` (int) *(optional)*:

   `t3://page?uid=13&type=3` will reference page 13 in type 3.

:aspect:`parameters` (string) *(optional, prefixed with &)*:

   `t3://page?uid=1313&my=param&will=get&added=here`

:aspect:`fragment` (string) *(optional, prefixed with #)*:

   `t3://page?alias=myfunkyalias#c123`

   `t3://page?uid=13&type=3#c123`

   `t3://page?uid=13&type3?my=param&will=get&added=here#c123`

file
----

:aspect:`uid` (int):

   The UID of a file within the FAL database table `sys_file`.

   `t3://file?uid=13`

:aspect:`identifier` (string):

   The identifier of a file when not indexed in FAL.

   `t3://file?identifier=folder/myfile.jpg`

folder
------

:aspect:`identifier` (string):

   The identifier of a given folder.

   `t3://folder?identifier=fileadmin`

:aspect:`storage` (string) *(optional)*:

   The FAL storage to the given folder.

   `t3://folder?storage=1&identifier=myfolder`




.. _typolink-link-handler:
.. _link-handler:

Using link handlers
===================

A feature allows you to register a link handler
for a keyword you define. For example, you can link to a page with id
34 with "<link 34>" in a typical bodytext field which converts <link>
tags with "->typolink". But what if you have an extension,
"pressrelease", and wanted to link to a press release item displayed
by a plugin on some page you don't remember? With this feature it's
possible to create the logic for this in that extension.

So, in a link field (the "parameter" value for ->typolink) you could
enter "pressrelease:123":

.. figure:: ../../Images/LinkHandler.png
   :alt: Screenshot of the "link" field in the TYPO3 Backend.

Some TypoScript will usually transfer this value to the "parameter"
attribute of the ->typolink call. When "pressrelease:123" enters
->typolink as the "parameter" it will be checked if "pressrelease" is
a keyword with which a link handler is associated and if so, that
handler is allowed to create the link.

Registering the handler for keyword "pressrelease" is done like this:

.. code-block:: php

   $TYPO3_CONF_VARS['SC_OPTIONS']['tslib/class.tslib_content.php']
     ['typolinkLinkHandler']['pressrelease'] =
     'EXT:pressrelease/class.linkHandler.php:&tx_linkHandler';

The class file "pressrelease/class.linkHandler.php" contains the class
"tx\_linkHandler" which could look like this:

.. code-block:: php

   class tx_linkHandler {
      function main($linktxt, $conf, $linkHandlerKeyword,
         $linkHandlerValue, $link_param, &$pObj) {
         $lconf = array();
         $lconf['useCacheHash'] = 1;
         $lconf['parameter'] = 34;
         $lconf['additionalParams'] = '&tx_pressrelease[showUid]=' .
            rawurlencode($linkHandlerValue);
         return $pObj->typoLink($linktxt, $lconf);
      }
   }

In this function, the value part after the keyword is set as the value
of a GET parameter, `&tx_pressrelease[showUid]` and the "parameter"
value of a new ->typolink call is set to "34" which assumes that on
page ID 34 a plugin is put that will display pressrelease 123 when
called with `&tx_pressrelease[showUid]=123`. In addition you can see
the "userCacheHash" attribute for the typolink function used in order
to produce a cached display.

The link that results from this operation will look like this::

   <a href="index.php?id=34&amp;
     tx_pressrelease[showUid]=123%3A456&amp;cHash=c0551fead6" >

The link would be encoded with RealURL and respect config.linkVars as
long as ->typolink is used to generate the final URL.
