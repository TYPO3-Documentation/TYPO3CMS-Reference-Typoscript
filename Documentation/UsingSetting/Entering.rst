=============================
Add TypoScript in the backend
=============================

At its most basic, TypoScript is entered manually in both the
:guilabel:`Constants` and :guilabel:`Setup` fields of template records (which are
stored in the database in table "sys_template").

This can be done in the :guilabel:`Web > Template` module in
the TYPO3 backend.

.. hint::

   It is best practice to use a Sitepackage extension to bundle
   various configuration in an extension. See :doc:`t3sitepackage:Index`.


.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/TemplatesRecords/TemplatesRecordListView.rst.txt

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/TemplatesRecords/TemplatesInput.rst.txt

If the "t3editor" system extension is not installed or has been
disabled via configuration options, the :guilabel:`Constants` and :guilabel:`Setup` fields
will be normal multi-line text fields.

.. index:: TypoScript; Include as file
.. _typoscript-syntax-typoscript-templates-structure-includes:

Include TypoScript files
========================

In both the "Constants" and "Setup" fields, the
:ref:`@import <t3coreapi:typoscript-syntax-includes>` syntax can be
used to include TypoScript contained inside files::

   # Import a single file
   @import 'EXT:myproject/Configuration/TypoScript/randomfile.typoscript'

   # Import multiple files of a single directory in file name order
   @import 'EXT:myproject/Configuration/TypoScript/*.typoscript'

   # The filename extension can be omitted and defaults to .typoscript
   @import 'EXT:myproject/Configuration/TypoScript/'

   # Import TypoScript files with legacy ".txt" extension
   @import 'EXT:myproject/Configuration/TypoScript/Setup/*.txt'


.. index:: TypoScript; Include from extensions
.. _static-includes:

Include TypoScript from extensions
==================================

It is also possible to "Include static" templates from extensions.


.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

#. In the :guilabel:`Web > Template` module, select :guilabel:`Info / Modify`

#. Click :guilabel:`Edit the whole template record`

   .. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/TemplatesModul/TemplatesStaticIncludes1.rst.txt

.. rst-class:: bignums-xxl

#. Chose the tab :guilabel:`Includes`

#. Click the templates to include in :guilabel:`Available Items`.

   .. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/TemplatesRecords/TemplatesStaticIncludes2.rst.txt

.. tip::

   The section :ref:`extdev-add-typoscript` explains how extension
   developers can make TypoScript available for inclusion in their
   extensions.


.. index:: TypoScript; Include other TypoScript templates

Include other TypoScript templates
==================================

Apart from this, it is also possible to include other TypoScript template
records (in the field called "Include Basis Template").

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/TemplatesRecords/TemplatesIncludes.rst.txt

.. index:: TypoScript; Analyzer
.. _typoscript-syntax-typoscript-templates-structure-analyzer:

Template analyzer
=================

With all those inclusions, it may happen that you lose the overview of the
template structure. The :guilabel:`Template Analyzer` (1) provides an overview
of this
structure. It shows all the templates that apply to the currently selected page,
taking into account inclusions and inheritance along the page tree.

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/TemplatesModul/TemplatesAnalyzer.rst.txt

Templates are taken into consideration from top to bottom, which means
that properties defined in one template may be overridden in templates
considered at a later point by the TypoScript parser.

In the Template Analyzer, you can click on any listed template (2) to view
the content of its "Setup" and "Constants" fields.

.. include:: /Images/AutomaticScreenshots/TemplatesModul/TemplatesAnalyzerDetails.rst.txt

The line numbers are compiled from the first template to be included,
which is why the numbers are so high.
