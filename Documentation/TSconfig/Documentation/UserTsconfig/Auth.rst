auth
====

The `auth` key is used for configuration of authentication services. However,
only a single and rarely used option is available currently:

auth.BE.redirectToURL
    Specifies a URL to redirect to after login is performed in the backend login form. This
    has been used in the past to redirect a backend user to the frontend to use frontend editing.
