Default values and override values for the *User Settings* module.

The "User tools > User settings" module may only represent a subset of the options from the table below.

.. figure::  ../Images/UserSettings.png
    :alt: Default values and overriding values for the "User tools > User settings" module

Properties from the list below are available the different prefixes `setup.default` and `setup.override`,
and there is another prefix to hide single fields:

setup.default.[someProperty]
    This sets *default* values of the property. A user may override these
    using its "User Settings" module. This affects only *new* users who did
    not login yet. It is not usually not possible to set new defaults for users
    who already logged in at least once. The only way to apply new defaults to
    existing users is by "Resetting All Backend User Preferences" in the
    "Admin tools > Maintenance" section of the install tool.

setup.override.[someProperty]
    This forces values for the properties of the list below, a user can not override these
    setting in its "User settings" module. So, overriding values will be impossible for the
    user to change himself and no matter what the current value is, the overriding
    value will overrule it.

    .. attention::

        There is a tricky aspect to these `setup.override`: If first you have set a
        value by `setup.override` and then remove it again, you will experience
        that the value persists to exist. This is because it is saved in the
        backend user's profile. Therefore, if you have once set a value, do
        *not* remove it again but rather set it blank if you want to disable
        the effect again!

setup.fields.[fieldName].disabled
    On top of being able to set default values or override them, it is also possible to
    hide fields in the "User Settings" module, using `setup.fields.[fieldName].disabled = 1`.
    You can find the names of the fields in the "Configuration" module by browsing the "User Settings" array, example:

    .. code-block:: typoscript

        # Do not show the 'emailMeAtLogin' field to the user in "User Settings" module
        setup.fields.emailMeAtLogin.disabled = 1

        # And fore the value of this field to be set to 1
        setup.override.emailMeAtLogin = 1
