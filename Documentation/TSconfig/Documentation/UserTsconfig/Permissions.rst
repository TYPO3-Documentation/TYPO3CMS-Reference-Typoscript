permissions
===========

Set permissions on a user or group basis. This is especially useful for access permissions on files and
folders as part of the :ref:`Digital assets management (FAL) <t3coreapi:fal>` of the core.

Read more about FAL access permissions in the :ref:`permission chapter <t3coreapi:fal-administration-permissions-user>`
of the core API document, but find some examples below:

.. code-block:: typoscript

    # Allow to create and upload files on all storages
    permissions.file.default.addFile = 1

    # Allow to add new folders if user has write permissions on parent folder
    permissions.file.default.addFolder = 1

    # Allow to edit contents of files on FAL storage with uid 1
    permissions.file.storage.1.writeFile = 1
