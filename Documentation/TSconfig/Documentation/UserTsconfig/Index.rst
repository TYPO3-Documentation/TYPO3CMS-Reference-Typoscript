User TSconfig
-------------

You can enter TSconfig for both backend users and groups. The
resulting TSconfig for a certain backend user is the accumulated
TSconfig for all the backend groups he is a member of. Thus you can
override formerly set options from the user groups by entering another
configuration in the TSconfig field of the user himself.
