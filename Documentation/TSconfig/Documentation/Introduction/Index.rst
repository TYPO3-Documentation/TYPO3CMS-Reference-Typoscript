About this document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TypoScript can be used to create templates for the TYPO3 frontend, but
also to configure the TYPO3 backend. In this case, it is called
"TSconfig". TSconfig is divided into configuration for pages ("Page
TSconfig") and configuration for users and groups ("User TSconfig").
Each variant is further detailed in its own chapter. TSconfig offers
vast possibilities of customizing the TYPO3 backend.

For details about the nature of TypoScript as a syntax, please read
the document :ref:`TypoScript Syntax and In-depth Study <t3tssyntax:start>`.
