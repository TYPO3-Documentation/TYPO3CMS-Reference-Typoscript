Syntax
======

While the objects, properties and conditions are different,
the *syntax* of TSconfig is basically the same as it is for
TypoScript in frontend TypoScript templates.

Please note the following differences:

*   In TSconfig no constants are available.
*   There are differences in the :ref:`conditions <conditions>` that can be used.
*   The general TypoScript syntax is described in
    :ref:`TypoScript syntax <t3tsref:typoscript-syntax>`.
