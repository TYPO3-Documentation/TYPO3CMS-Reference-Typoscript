Page TSconfig
-------------

The Page TSconfig primarily concerns configuration of the modules in
the TYPO3 backend. It may also relate to values in the frontend
display occasionally.

The Page TSconfig for a page is accumulated from the root and extends
to cover the whole branch of subpages as well (unless values are
overridden further out).
