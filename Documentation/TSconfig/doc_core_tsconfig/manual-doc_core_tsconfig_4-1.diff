 Introduction
 TypoScript is mainly known as the means to configure Templates Records for TYPO3 based websites. However TypoScript itself is basically a way to define values in a hierarchy. And so TypoScript is also used to make detailed configuration of the backend, both regarding users and groups and the way modules are working in branches of the Page Tree. This is done through the ?TSconfig? which is found for both the backend and frontend users/groups in addition to the pages. This is often referred to as User TSconfig and Page TSconfig.Page TSconfig / User TSconfig
