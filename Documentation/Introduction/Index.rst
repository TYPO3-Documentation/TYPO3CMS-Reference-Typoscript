.. _about-tsref:

About this document
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This document is a complete reference to all objects and properties of
TypoScript as used in TYPO3 TypoScript templates (and not in TSconfig).

For explanations about the syntax of TypoScript itself, please refer
to the "TypoScript Syntax and In-Depth Study" manual.

This version is updated for TYPO3 CMS version 6.2.


.. _what-s-new:

What's new
^^^^^^^^^^

The main changes include: The cObject FILES got the new properties
"begin" and "maxItems" and the property "sorting" got the new
sub-property "direction". The content object IMAGE now supports
responsive images using the properties "layoutKey" and "layout" and
"sourceCollection". cObject HMENU got a new special menu type called
"categories". For the RECORDS content object the property "categories"
has been introduced, which makes records related to selected categories
available for rendering.

The page property "includeCSSLibs" allows to include CSS libraries. The
page properties includeJS, includeJSLibs and includeCSS were added
a new "allWrap.splitChar" property.

A new keyword "devIP" can be used in the IP condition. The userFunc
condition can now handle multiple parameters and now supports quotes
for its arguments. A new condition called "applicationContext" has been
amended. Detection of Windows 8 has been added to the system condition.

The new property "includeRecordsWithoutDefaultTranslation" of the select
function allows to also fetch records, which do *not* have a parent in
the default language. The new stdWrap property "encodeForJavaScriptValue"
enables you to encode values for usage in JavaScript strings.

Certain getText properties can be used without second parameter.

optionSplit has been added to the replace property of the stdWrap
function replacement. The new property is called
"useOptionSplitReplace".

Additionally various descriptions were improved and many smaller
mistakes were fixed.

.. _general-information:

General information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. _case-sensitivity:

Case sensitivity
""""""""""""""""

All names and references in TypoScript are **case sensitive!** This
is very important to notice. For example watch the words "TEXT" and "value"
in this TypoScript code::

   myObject = TEXT
   myObject.value = <strong>Some HTML code</strong>

This is not the same as ::

   myObject = text
   myObject.Value = <strong>Some HTML code</strong>

While the first will be recognized as the content object "TEXT" and
will produce the desired output, the latter will not be recognized and
will not output anything. Even if you wrote **"TEXT"** in uppercase in the
second example, it would still not work, because the property **"value"**
is misspelled.

Always remember: In this manual the case of objects **is** important.


.. _version-numbers:

Version numbers
"""""""""""""""

For new features TSref includes a note in which TYPO3 version the
feature was added. If such a note is missing, the feature is part of
TYPO3 since version 4.5 at least.
