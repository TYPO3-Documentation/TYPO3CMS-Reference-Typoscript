============================
Object names in this section
============================

Whenever you see a reference to anything named an "object" in this
section it's a reference to a "Gifbuilder Object" and not the
"cObjects" from the previous section. Confusion could happen, because
"TEXT" and "IMAGE" are objects in *both* areas; note that they are
different each time!
