==================
GIFBUILDER objects
==================

Whenever you see a reference to anything named an "object" in this section it
is a reference to a GIFBUILDER object and not the :ref:`cObjects <cobject>`.
Confusion could happen, because :typoscript:`TEXT` and :typoscript:`IMAGE` are
objects in *both* areas; note that they are different each time!
