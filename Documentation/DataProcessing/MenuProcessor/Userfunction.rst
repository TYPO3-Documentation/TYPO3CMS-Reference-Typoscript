============================================
Userfunction menu (For backward compability)
============================================

..  attention::
    It is still possible to create a menu with :typoscript:`special = userfunction`
    for backward compatibility reasons.

    However we would advise you to write a :ref:`customized MenuProcessor <CustomDataProcessors>`
    and style the output with Fluid instead.

See :ref:`TYPO3 11.5 -Userfunction menu <t3tsref/11.5:hmenu-special-userfunction>`
for examples how to use the language menu with the HMENU.
