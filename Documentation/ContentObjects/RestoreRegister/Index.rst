=================
RESTORE\_REGISTER
=================

This unsets the latest changes in the register array as set by
:ref:`LOAD_REGISTER <cobj-load-register>`.

Internally registers work like a stack where the original register is
saved when :ref:`LOAD_REGISTER <cobj-load-register>` is called. When a
RESTORE\_REGISTER cObject is called, the last element is pulled off
that stack and the register is replaced with the content of the
previous element.

.. note::
   :typoscript:`RESTORE_REGISTER` has no properties.

Example:
========

The following example shows how LOAD_REGISTER and RESTORE_REGISTER can
be used to load values into the register and to restore previous values
again.
