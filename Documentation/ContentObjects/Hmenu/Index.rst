HMENU
^^^^^

This cObject generates hierarchical menus. It is the one usually being
used to create the navigation menu of websites.

The cObject HMENU allows you to define the global settings of the menu
as a whole. For the rendering of the single menu levels, different
:ref:`menu objects <menu-objects>` can be used.

Apart from just creating a hierarchical menu of the pages as they are
structured in the page tree, HMENU also allows you to use the
:ref:`.special property <hmenu-special-property>` to create special
menus. These special menus take characteristics of special menu types
into account.


.. ### BEGIN~OF~TABLE ###

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-number:

         (1 / 2 / 3 /...)

   Data type
         :ref:`menu object <data-type-menuobj>`

   Description
         For every menu level, that should be rendered, an according entry must
         exist. It defines the menu object that should render the menu items on
         the according level. 1 is the first level, 2 is the second level, 3 is
         the third level and so on.

         **The property "1" is required!**

         The entry 1 for the first level always must exist. All other levels only
         will be generated when they are configured.

         **Example:** ::

            temp.sidemenu = HMENU
            temp.sidemenu.1 = GMENU
            temp.sidemenu.1 {
              # Configuration of that GMENU here...
            }
            temp.sidemenu.2 = TMENU
            temp.sidemenu.2 {
              # Configuration of that TMENU here...
            }
            temp.sidemenu.3 = TMENU
            temp.sidemenu.3 {
              # Configuration of that TMENU here...
            }

         This creates a menu with up to three levels: The first level being a GMENU,
         the second and third level being TMENUs.

         TYPO3 offers :ref:`a variety of menu objects <menu-objects>`.

   Default
         (no menu)


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-cache-period:

         cache\_period

   Data type
         integer

   Description
         The number of seconds a menu may remain in cache. If this value is not
         set, the first available value of the following will be used:

         1) cache\_timeout of the current page

         2) config.cache\_period defined globally

         3) 86400 (= 1 day)


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-entrylevel:

         entryLevel

   Data type
         integer /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Defines at which level in the rootLine the menu should start.

         Default is "0" which gives us a menu of the very first pages on the
         site.

         If the value is < 0, entryLevel is chosen from "behind" in the
         rootLine. Thus "-1" is a menu with items from the outermost level,
         "-2" is the level before the outermost...

   Default
         0


.. container:: table-row

   Property

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-minitems:

         minItems

   Data type
         integer /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         The minimum number of items in the menu. If the number of pages does
         not reach this level, a dummy-page with the title "..." and
         uid=[currentpage\_id] is inserted.

         **Note:** Affects all sub menus as well. To set the value for each
         menu level individually, set the properties in the menu objects (see
         "Common properties" table).


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-maxitems:

         maxItems

   Data type
         integer /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description

         integer /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>` :ref:`+calc <objects-calc>`

   Description
         The first item in the menu.

         **Example:**

         This results in a menu, where the first two items are skipped starting
         with item number 3::

            begin = 3

         **Note:** Affects all sub menus as well. (See "minItems" for a
         notice.)


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-excludeuidlist:

         excludeUidList

         list of integers /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         This is a list of page uid's to exclude when the select statement is
         done. Comma-separated. You may add "current" to the list to exclude
         the current page.

         **Example:**

         The pages with these uid-numbers will **not** be within the menu!

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-excludedoktypes:

         excludeDoktypes

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-includenotinmenu:

         includeNotInMenu

   Data type
         boolean

   Description
         If set, pages with the checkbox "Not in menu" checked will be included
         in menus.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-alwaysactivepidlist:

         alwaysActivePIDlist

   Data type
         list of integers /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         This is a list of page UID numbers that will always be regarded as
         active menu items and thereby automatically opened regardless of the
         rootline.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-protectlvar:

         protectLvar

   Data type
         boolean / keyword

   Description
         If set, then for each page in the menu it will be checked if an
         Alternative Page Language record for the language defined in
         "config.sys\_language\_uid" (typically defined via &L) exists for the
         page. If that is not the case and the pages "Localization settings"
         have the "Hide page if no translation for current language exists"
         flag set, then the menu item will link to a non accessible page that
         will yield an error page to the user. Setting this option will prevent
         that situation by simply adding "&L=0" for such pages, meaning that
         they will switch to the default language rather than keeping the
         current language.

         The check is only carried out if a translation is requested
         ("config.sys\_language\_uid" is not zero).

         **Keyword: "all"**

         When set to "all" the same check is carried out but it will not look
         if "Hide page if no translation for current language exists" is set -
         it always reverts to default language if no translation is found.

         For these options to make sense, they should only be used when
         "config.sys\_language\_mode" is not set to "content\_fallback".


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-addquerystring:

         addQueryString

   Data type
         string

   Description
         *see typolink.addQueryString*

         **Note:** This works only for *special=language*.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-if:

         if

   Data type
         :ref:`->if <if>`

   Description
         If "if" returns false, the menu is not generated.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         .. _hmenu-wrap:

.. _hmenu-special-property:

The .special property
"""""""""""""""""""""

This property makes it possible to create menus that are not strictly
reflecting the current page-structure, but rather creating menus with
links to pages like "next/previous", "last modified", "pages in a
certain page" and so on.


.. note::

   :typoscript:`.entryLevel` generally is not supported together with the
   :code:.special` property! The only exception is :typoscript:`special = keywords`.

Also be aware that this property selects pages for the first level in
the menu. Submenus by menuObjects 2+ will be created as usual.


.. _hmenu-special-directory:

special = directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A HMENU of type special = directory lets you create a menu listing the

   Description
         This will generate a menu with the two pages (uid=35 and uid=56)
         listed::

            20 = HMENU
            20.special = list
            20.special.value = 35, 56

.. _hmenu-special-updated:

special = updated
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An HMENU with the property special = updated will create a menu of the
most recently updated pages.

**A note on ordering:** The sorting menu is by default done in reverse
order (desc) with the field specified by "mode", but setting
"alternativeSortingField" for the menu object (e.g. TMENU or GMENU,
see later) will override that.

Mount pages are supported.

   Description
         Only show pages, whose update-date *at most* lies this number of
         seconds in the past. Or with other words: Pages with update-dates
         older than the current time minus this number of seconds will not
         be shown in the menu no matter what.

         By default all pages are shown. You may use +-\*/ for calculations.

.. _hmenu-special-updated-examples:

Example for special = updated:
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

The following example will generate a menu of the most recently
updated pages from the branches in the tree starting with the uid's
(uid=35 and uid=56) listed. Furthermore the field "tstamp" is used
(default is SYS\_LASTCHANGED) and the tree depth is 2 levels. Also a
maximum of 8 pages will be shown and they must have been updated
within the last three days (3600\*24\*3)::

   20 = HMENU
   20.special = updated
   20.special.value = 35, 56

   }


.. _hmenu-special-rootline:

special = rootline
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The path of pages from the current page to the root page of the page
tree is called "rootline".

A rootline menu is a menu which shows you these pages one by one in
their hierarchical order.

An HMENU with the property special = rootline creates a rootline menu
(also known as "breadcrumb trail") that could look like this:

Page level 1 > Page level 2 > Page level 3 > *Current page*

Such a click path facilitates the user's orientation on the website
and makes navigation to a certain page level easier.

Mount pages are supported.

         level by using the level number as sub-property.

         **Example:**

         Here the links to pages on level 3 will have target="page", while all
         other levels will have target="\_top" as defined for the TMENU
         property .target. ::

         **next** / **prev:** Links to the next page / the previous page.
         Next and previous pages are from the same "pid" as the current page id
         (or "value") - that is the next item in a menu with the current page.
         Also referred to as current level.

         If ".prevnextToSection" is set then next/prev will link to the first
         page of the next section / to the last page of the previous section,
         too.

         **nextsection** / **prevsection:** Links to the next section / the
         previous section. A section is defined as the subpages of a page on
         the same level as the parent (pid) page of the current page. Will not
         work if the parent page of the current page is the root page of the
         site.

         .. figure:: ../../Images/ContentObjectsHmenuSpecialBrowse.png
            :alt: Example for the usage of the property "items".

         **nextsection\_last** / **prevsection\_last:** Where
         nextsection/prevsection links to the first page in a section, these
         link to the last pages. If there is only one page in the section that
         will be both first and last.Will not work if the parent page of the
         current page is the root page of the site.

         **first** / **last:** First / last page on the current level. If
         there is only one page on the current level that page will be both
         first and last.

         **up:** Links to the parent (pid) page of the current page (up 1
         level). Will always be available.

         **index:** Links to the parent of the parent pageof the current
         page(up 2 levels). May not be available, if that page is out of the
         rootline.

         **Examples:**

         If id = 20 is the current page then:

         21 = prev and first, 19 = next, 18 = last, 17 = up, 1 = index, 10 =
         nextsection, 11 = nextsection\_last

         prevsection and prevsection\_last are not present because id = 3 has
         no subpages!

[tsref:(cObject).HMENU.special = categories]


.. _hmenu-special-language:

special = language
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Creates a language selector menu. Typically this is made as a menu
with flags for each language a page is translated to and when the user
clicks any element the same page id is hit but with a change to the
"&L" parameter in the URL.

The "language" type will create menu items based on the current page
record but with the language record for each language overlaid if
available. The items all link to the current page id and only "&L" is
changed.

Note on item states:

When "TSFE->sys\_language\_uid" matches the sys\_language uid for an
element the state is set to "ACT", otherwise "NO". However, if a page
is not available due to the pages "Localization settings" (which can
disable translations) or if no Alternative Page Language record was
found (can be disabled with ".normalWhenNoLanguage", see below) the
state is set to "USERDEF1" for non-active items and "USERDEF2" for
active items. So in total there are four states to create designs for.
It is recommended to disable the link on menu items rendered with
"USERDEF1" and "USERDEF2" in this case since they are disabled exactly
because a page in that language does not exist and might even issue an
error if tried accessed (depending on site configuration).

Example: Creating hierarchical menus of custom links
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

By default the HMENU object is designed to create menus from pages in
TYPO3. Such pages are represented by their page-record contents.
Usually the "title" field is used for the title and the "uid" field is
used to create a link to that page in the menu.

However the HMENU and sub-menu objects are so powerful that it would
be very useful to use these objects for creating menus of links which
does not relate to pages in TYPO3 by their ids. This could be a menu
reflecting a menu structure of a plugin where each link might link to
the same page id in TYPO3 but where the difference would be in some
parameter value.

First, this listing creates a menu in three levels where the first two
are graphical items::

Notice how the array contains "fake" page-records which has *no* uid
field, only a "title" and "\_OVERRIDE\_HREF" as required and some
other fields as it fits.

- The first level with items "Contact" and "Products" contains "title"
  and "\_OVERRIDE\_HREF" fields, but "Contact" extends this by a
  "\_SUB\_MENU" array which contains a similar array of items.

- The first item on the second level, "Offices", contains a field called
  "\_OVERRIDE\_TARGET". Further the item has its state set to "ACT"
  which means it will render as an "active" item (you will have to
  calculate such stuff manually when you are not rendering a menu of
  real pages!). Finally there is even another sub-level of menu items.
