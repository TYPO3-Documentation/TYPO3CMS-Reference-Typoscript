    The :ref:`LanguageMenuProcessor <LanguageMenuProcessor>` can be used to
    create a language menu styled by Fluid.

The :typoscript:`special = language` type will create menu items based on
the current page record but with the language record for each language
overlaid if available.

Properties
==========

..  _hmenu-special-language-value:

special.value
-------------

..  confval:: special.value
    :name: hmenu-language-special-value
    :type: comma separated list of language UIDs /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>` or `auto`

    The number of elements in this list determines the number of menu
    items. Setting to `auto` will include all available languages from
    the current site.

..  _hmenu-special-language-normalwhennolanguage:

special.normalWhenNoLanguage
----------------------------


..  confval:: special.normalWhenNoLanguage
    :name: hmenu-language-special-normalWhenNoLanguage
    :type: boolean

    If set, the button for a language will be rendered as a non-
    disabled button even if no translation is found for the language.

Example: Create a language menu with pure TypoScript
====================================================

   For a language menu styled by Fluid see
   :ref:`LanguageMenuProcessor <LanguageMenuProcessor>`.

Note on item states
====================

When the language of the menu element matches the current language of the page
displayed, the state is set to `ACT`, otherwise `NO`. However, if a page
is not available due to the pages "Localization settings" (which can
disable translations) or if no Alternative Page Language record was
found (can be disabled with `.normalWhenNoLanguage`, see below) the
state is set to `USERDEF1` for non-active items and `USERDEF2` for
active items. So in total there are four states to create designs for.
It is recommended to disable the link on menu items rendered with
`USERDEF1` and `USERDEF2` in this case since they are disabled exactly
because a page in that language does not exist and might even issue an
error if tried accessed (depending on site configuration).
