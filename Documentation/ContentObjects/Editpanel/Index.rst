EDITPANEL
=========

A content object of type EDITPANEL is inserted only if a backend user is logged in
and if a FE-editing extension is installed and loaded. What gets
displayed exactly may depend on which FE-editing extension is used.
The reference below is related to the "feedit" system extension. In
such a case the EDITPANEL also requires that the Admin Panel be
displayed (config.admPanel = 1) and that the user has checked the
"Display Edit Icons" option. Whenever the edit panel is inserted, page
caching is disabled.

The edit panel inserts icons for moving, editing, deleting, hiding and
creating records.

In conjunction with css\_styled\_content, an EDITPANEL will appear for
each content element on the page. It is also possible to insert an
EDITPANEL as cObject in the template, using TypoScript.


.. note::

   The extension "feedit" needs to be installed for this to work.
