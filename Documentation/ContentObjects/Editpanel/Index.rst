EDITPANEL
=========

A content object of type EDITPANEL is inserted only if a backend user is logged in
and if a FE-editing extension is installed and loaded. What gets
displayed exactly may depend on which FE-editing extension is used.
The reference below is related to EDITPANEL settings found in the TYPO3 core.
Different FE-editing extension may include their own settings that are not
present in this list. In such a case, it is advised to look up that extensions
documentation for more information.

In the case of the "feedit" extension, the EDITPANEL also requires that the
Admin Panel be displayed (config.admPanel = 1) and that the user has checked the
"Display Edit Icons" option. Whenever the edit panel is inserted, page
caching is disabled.

The edit panel inserts icons for moving, editing, deleting, hiding and
creating records.

An EDITPANEL will appear for each content element on the page. It is also
possible to insert an EDITPANEL as cObject in the template, using TypoScript.


.. note::

   A FE-editing extension needs to be installed for this to work. The
   former "feedit" system extension has been dropped from the TYPO3 core
   since v10, but is still available as third-party extension:

   `ext:feedit <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/feedit/>`__

   There are other, more "up to date" FE-editing extensions, as well. For
   instance you can try out "frontend_editing":

   `ext:frontend_editing <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/frontend_editing/>`__
