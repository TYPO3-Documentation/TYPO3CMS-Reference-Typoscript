======================
DatabaseQueryProcessor
======================

The :php:`DatabaseQueryProcessor` fetches records from the database,
using the default :ref:`select` semantics  from TypoScript. The result
then gets handed over to the :ref:`cobj-fluidtemplate` as an array.

This way a :ref:`cobj-fluidtemplate` cObject can iterate over the
array of records.


Options:
========

.. confval:: if

   :Required: false
   :type: :ref:`if` condition
   :default: ''

   If the condition is not met the data is not processed

.. confval:: table

   :Required: true
   :type: string, :ref:`stdWrap`
   :default: ''

   Name of the table from which the records should be fetched

.. confval:: as

   :Required: false
   :type: string, :ref:`stdWrap`
   :default: 'records'

   The variable's name to be used in the Fluid template

.. confval:: dataProcessing

   :Required: false
   :type: array of :ref:`dataProcessing`
   :default: ''

   Array of DataProcessors to be applied to all fetched records.


.. note:: All other options will be interpreted as in the TypoScript function
   "select", including :typoscript:`pidInList`, :typoscript:`orderBy`,
   :typoscript:`where` etc. See the reference of :ref:`select`.

.. warning:: When using the DatabaseQueryProcessor, you may encounter
   issues with language and/or versioning overlays, that currently
   can not be resolved. See `here <https://forge.typo3.org/issues/85284#note-5>`__
   for more information.


Example: Display haiku records
==============================

Please see also :ref:`dataProcessing-about-examples`.

TypoScript
----------

We define the dataProcessing property to use the DatabaseQueryProcessor:

.. include:: /CodeSnippets/DataProcessing/TypoScript/DatabaseQueryProcessor.rst.txt


The Fluid template
------------------

In the Fluid template then iterate over the records. As we used the recursive data
processor :ref:`FilesProcessor` on the image records we also can output the images.

.. include:: /CodeSnippets/DataProcessing/Template/DataProcDb.rst.txt


Output
------

The array of records each contains the data of the table in :php:`data` and
the data of the images in :php:`files`.
