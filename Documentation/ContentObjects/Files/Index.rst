.. _cobj-files:

FILES
^^^^^

(Since TYPO3 CMS 6.0) This content object was integrated with the
File Abstraction Layer (FAL) and is there to output information
about files.


.. note::

   Do not mix this up with the cObject :ref:`FILE <cobj-file>`; both are
   different cObjects.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         files

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Comma-separated list of sys_file UIDs, which are loaded
         into the FILES object.

         **Example:**

         .. code-block:: typoscript

            page.10 = FILES
            page.10.files = 12,15,16


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         references

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>` or array

   Description
         Provides a way to load files from a file field (of type
         IRRE with sys_file_reference as child table). You can either
         provide a UID or a comma-separated list of UIDs from the
         database table sys_file_reference or you have to specify a
         table, uid and field name in the according sub-properties of
         "references". See further documentation of these
         sub-properties in the table below.

         **Examples:**

         .. code-block:: typoscript

            references = 27,28

         This will get the items from the database table
         sys_file_reference with the UIDs 27 and 28.

         .. code-block:: typoscript

            references {
              table = tt_content
              uid = 256
              fieldName = image
            }

         This will fetch all relations to the image field of the
         tt_content record "256".

         .. code-block:: typoscript

            references {
              table = pages
              uid.data = page:uid
              fieldName = media
            }

         This will fetch all items related to the page.media field.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         collections

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Comma-separated list of sys_file_collection UIDs, which
         are loaded into the FILES object.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         folders

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Comma-separated list of combined folder identifiers which
         are loaded into the FILES object.

         A combined folder identifier looks like this:
         [storageUid]:[folderIdentifier].

         The first part is the UID of the storage and the second
         part the identifier of the folder. The identifier of the
         folder is often equivalent to the relative path of the
         folder.

         **Example:**

         .. code-block:: typoscript

            page.10 = FILES
            page.10.folders = 2:mypics/,4:myimages/


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         sorting

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Name of the field, which should be used to sort the files.

         Available sub-property:

         **direction:** (Since TYPO3 CMS 6.2) string /stdWrap. The direction, in which
         the files should be sorted. Possible values are "asc" for ascending and
         "desc" for descending. Ascending is the default.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         begin

   Data type
         integer /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         (Since TYPO3 CMS 6.2) The first item to return. If not set (default), items
         beginning with the first one are returned.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         maxItems

   Data type
         integer /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         (Since TYPO3 CMS 6.2) Maximum number of items to return. If not set (default),
         items until the last one are returned. If begin and maxItems together
         exceed the number of available items, no items beyond the last available
         item will be returned - output won't continue with the first available item.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         renderObj

   Data type
         :ref:`cObject <data-type-cobject>` :ref:`+optionSplit <objects-optionsplit>`

   Description
         The cObject used for rendering the files. It is executed
         once for every file. Note that during each execution you can
         find information about the current file using the getText
         property "file" with the "current" keyword.

         **Example:**

         .. code-block:: typoscript

            page.10.renderObj = TEXT
            page.10.renderObj {
              stdWrap.data = file:current:size
              stdWrap.wrap = <p>File size:<strong>|</strong></p>
            }

         This returns the size of the current file.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         stdWrap

   Data type
         :ref:`->stdWrap <stdwrap>`


[tsref:(cObject).FILES]


.. _cobj-files-references:

.. container:: table-row

   Property
         table

   Description
         The table name of the table having the file field.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         uid

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         The UID of the record from which to fetch the referenced files.


.. container:: table-row

   Property
         fieldName

   Data type
         string /:ref:`stdWrap <stdwrap>`

   Description
         Field name of the file field in the table.


[tsref:(cObject).FILES.references]


.. _cobj-files-examples:

Examples:
"""""""""

In this example, we first load files using several of the methods
explained above (using sys_file UIDs, collection UIDs, and folders).
Then we use the :ref:`TEXT <cobj-text>` cObject as renderObj to output
the file size of all files that were found:

.. code-block:: typoscript

	page.10 = FILES

	page.10.files = 12,15,16
	page.10.collections = 2,9
	page.10.folders = 1:mypics/

	page.10.renderObj = TEXT
	page.10.renderObj {
		stdWrap.data = file:current:size
		stdWrap.wrap = <p>File size: <strong>|</strong></p>
	}


In this second example, we use "references" to get the images related
to a given page (in this case, the current page). We start with the
first image and return up to five images. Each image is then rendered
as an :ref:`IMAGE <cobj-image>` cObject with some meta data coming from
the file itself (publicUrl) or from the reference to it (title):

.. code-block:: typoscript

	page.20 = FILES
	page.20 {
		references {
		table = pages
		uid.data = tsfe:id
		fieldName = media
		}

		begin = 0
		maxItems = 5

		renderObj = IMAGE
		renderObj {
			file.import.data = file:current:uid
			file.treatIdAsReference = 1
			altText.data = file:current:title
			wrap = <div class="slide">|</div>
		}
		stdWrap.wrap = <div class="carousel">|</div>
	}
