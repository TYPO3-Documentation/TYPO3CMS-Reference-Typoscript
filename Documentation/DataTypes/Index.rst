=================
Simple data types
=================

The values assigned to properties in TypoScript are often of a
specific format. These formats are described in this chapter.

For example, if a value is defined as the type :typoscript:`<tag>`, HTML code has to be
supplied. If it is of the type :typoscript:`resource`, it's a reference to a file from
the resource-field in the template. If the type is :typoscript:`GraphicColor`, a
color-definition is expected and an HTML color code or comma-separated
RGB-values have to be provided.

The following is a list of available data types, their usage, purpose and
examples.

.. _data-type-align:

align
-----

:aspect:`Data type:`
   align

:aspect:`Description:`
   Decides about alignment.

:aspect:`Examples:`
   :typoscript:`left`, :typoscript:`center`, :typoscript:`right`

:aspect:`Default:`
   :typoscript:`left`


.. _data-type-boolean:
.. _data-type-bool:

boolean
-------

:aspect:`Data type:`
   boolean

:aspect:`Description:`
   Possible values for boolean variables are `1` and `0`
   meaning TRUE and FALSE.

   Everything else is `evaluated to one of these values by PHP`__:
   Non-empty strings (except `0` [zero]) are treated as TRUE,
   empty strings are evaluated to FALSE.

   __ https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.boolean.php

:aspect:`Examples:`
   ::

      dummy.enable = 0   # false, preferred notation
      dummy.enable = 1   # true,  preferred notation
      dummy.enable =     # false, because the value is empty

.. _data-type-case:

case
----

:aspect:`Data type:`
   case

:aspect:`Description:`
   Do a case conversion.

:aspect:`Possible values:`
   ============================= ==========================================================
   Value                         Effect
   ============================= ==========================================================
   :typoscript:`upper`           Convert all letters of the string to upper case
   :typoscript:`lower`           Convert all letters of the string to lower case
   :typoscript:`capitalize`      Uppercase the first character of each word in the string
   :typoscript:`ucfirst`         Convert the first letter of the string to upper case
   :typoscript:`lcfirst`         Convert the first letter of the string to lower case
   :typoscript:`uppercamelcase`  Convert underscored `upper_camel_case` to `UpperCamelCase`
   :typoscript:`lowercamelcase`  Convert underscored `lower_camel_case` to `lowerCamelCase`
   ============================= ==========================================================

:aspect:`Example:`
   Code::

      10 = TEXT
      10.value = Hello world!
      10.case = upper

   Result::

      HELLO WORLD!


.. _data-type-date-conf:

   The following abbreviations are available:

   === ===========================================================
   Abb The abbreviation is expanded to:
   === ===========================================================

   === ===========================================================

:aspect:`Example:`
   ::

      d-m-y

.. _data-type-degree:

degree
------

:aspect:`Data type:`
   degree

:aspect:`Description:`
   -90 to 90, integers

:aspect:`Example:`
   45

.. _data-type-dir:

dir
---

:aspect:`Data type:`
   dir

:aspect:`Syntax:`
   [path relative to the web root of the site] \| [list of valid
   extensions] \| [sorting: name, size, ext, date] \| [reverse: "r"] \|
   [return full path: boolean]

:aspect:`Description:`
   Files matching are returned in a comma-separated string.

:aspect:`Example:`
   This example returns a list of all pdf, gif and jpg-files from
   :file:`fileadmin/files/` sorted by their name reversely and with the full path (with
   :file:`fileadmin/files/` prepended)::

      fileadmin/files/ | pdf,gif,jpg | name | r | true

.. _data-type-function-name:

function name
-------------

:aspect:`Data type:`
   function name

:aspect:`Description:`
   Indicates a function or method in a class to call. See more information at
   the :ref:`USER cObject <cobj-user>`.

   If no namespaces are used, then the class or function name, but not the method
   name, should probably be prefixed with :php:`user_`. The prefix can be
   changed in the :php:`$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']` config though. The function
   / method is normally called with 2 parameters, :php:`$conf` which is the
   TypoScript configuration and :php:`$content`, some content to be processed and
   returned.

   .. Which entry in TYPO3_CONF_VARS enables the user-prefix to be changed? This
      should be mentioned. Looks like this entry has gone and this info no
      longer valid.

   If no namespaces are used and if a method in a class is called, it is checked (when using the
   :typoscript:`USER`/:typoscript:`USER_INT` objects) whether a class with the same name, but
   prefixed with :php:`ux_` is present and if so, *this* class is instantiated
   instead. See the document "Inside TYPO3" for more information on extending
   classes in TYPO3!

   .. Where is this feature mentioned? We should add a reference here.

:aspect:`Examples:`
   Method in namespaced class. This is the preferred version:

   .. code-block:: php

      Your\NameSpace\YourClass->reverseString

   Single Function:

   .. code-block:: php

      user_reverseString

   Method in class without namespace:

   .. code-block:: php

      user_yourClass->reverseString

.. _data-type-gettext:

getText
-------

:aspect:`Data type:`
   getText

:aspect:`Description:`
   The getText data type is some kind of tool box allowing to retrieve
   values from a variety of sources, e.g. from GET/POST variables, from
   registers, values from the page tree, items in the page menus, records from any database table, etc.

   The general syntax is as follows::

      key : code

   where :typoscript:`key` indicates the source and :typoscript:`code` is some form of path or
   pointer to the value, which depends on the key used. The various keys and
   their possible codes are described below.

   The :typoscript:`code` can contain pipe characters :typoscript:`|` to separate keys
   in a multi-dimensional array. This e.g. works with :typoscript:`TSFE`::

      foo = TSFE : fe_user|user|username

   Some codes work with different separator, which is documented right at the
   code.
   Spaces around the colon (:typoscript:`:`) are irrelevant. The :typoscript:`key` is
   case-insensitive.

   By separating the value of getText with :typoscript:`//` (double slash) a number of
   codes can be supplied and getText will return the first one, which is not
   empty ("" or zero).

   To get the content of the field "header". If "header is empty, "title" is
   retrieved. If "title" is empty as well, it finally gets the field "uid"::

      foo = field : header // field : title // field : uid


.. include:: Properties/GetText.rst.txt

.. _data-type-graphiccolor:

GraphicColor
------------

:aspect:`Data type:`
   GraphicColor

:aspect:`Syntax:`
   [colordef] : [modifier]

   Where modifier can be an integer which is added or subtracted to the three
   RGB-channels or a floating point with an :typoscript:`*` before, which will then
   multiply the values with that factor.

:aspect:`Description:`
   The color can be given as HTML-color or as a comma-separated list of
   RGB-values (integers). An extra parameter can be given, that will modify the
   color mathematically:

:aspect:`Examples:`
   red *(HTML-color)*

   #ffeecc *(HTML-color)*

   255,0,255 *(RGB-integers)*

   *Extra:*

   red *: \*0.8 ("red" is darkened by factor 0.8)*

   #ffeecc *: +16 ("ffeecc" is going to #fffedc because 16 is added)*

.. _data-type-html-code:

HTML code
---------

:aspect:`Data type:`

   Standard is pdf, gif, jpg, jpeg, tif, bmp, ai, pcx, tga, png.

   The value **"web"** is special. This will just ensure that an image is
   converted to a web image format (gif or jpg) if it happens not to be already!

   web *(gif or jpg ..)*

.. _data-type-imgresource:

imgResource

   root line. The key is equal to the level the current page is on
   measured relatively to the root of the website.

   If the key exists the uid of the level that key pointed to is inserted
   instead of {x}.

      <a href="?id={0}"> | </a>

   Spaces between the wrap-parts and the divider ("|") are trimmed off
   from each part of the wrap.

   If you want to use more sophisticated data functions, then you
   should use `stdWrap.dataWrap` instead of `wrap`.

   A `wrap` is processed and rendered as the last of the other components of
   a cObject.
