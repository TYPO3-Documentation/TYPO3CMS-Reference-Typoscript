   Data type
         resource

   Examples
         Reference to a file in the file system:* ::

            fileadmin/picture.gif

   Comment
         If the value contains a "/", it is expected to be a reference
         (absolute or relative) to a file in the file system. There is no
         support for wildcard characters in the name of the reference.
