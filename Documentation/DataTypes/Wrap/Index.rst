         Used to wrap something. The vertical bar ("|") is the place, where
         your content will be inserted; the parts on the left and right of the
         vertical line are placed on the left and right side of the content.

         Spaces between the wrap-parts and the divider ("|") are trimmed off
         from each part of the wrap.
